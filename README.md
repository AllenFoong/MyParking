# Introduction to MyParking
Our group has developed a Smart Parking System — a web-based platform that allows users to book parking slots online with convenience and ease. The system displays available parking slots in a grid layout with associated images, allows users to select a date and specific time for booking, and prevents double-bookings by disabling already reserved time slots.

Why We Chose This Project:
We chose to develop this Smart Parking System to address a common issue faced in urban areas — the difficulty of finding and managing parking. Our goal was to create a solution that could reduce congestion, improve time efficiency for drivers, and showcase how modern web development combined with simple database logic can create a meaningful real-world application.

We also aimed to enhance our understanding of web technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL integration on a hosting platform (InfinityFree). This project gave us the opportunity to collaborate on front-end UI/UX, back-end database design, and real-time booking logic.
