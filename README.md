# Introduxtion to MyParking
In this project, our team designed and developed an interactive Smart Parking System using web technologies and hosted it online via InfinityFree. The goal of this project was to apply software engineering principles and agile methodologies (Scrum) in a practical context while solving a real-world problem â€” efficient and user-friendly parking reservation.

This system allows users to register, log in, and reserve specific parking slots based on available dates and times. It dynamically prevents overlapping bookings and enables users to view and cancel their reservations. The project emphasizes frontend usability and backend logic, combining HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.

The purpose of this system was to demonstrate real-world applications of core software engineering concepts, including iterative development, collaboration using version control, system architecture design, and interface implementation. Additionally, the system addresses key programming concerns such as data validation, real-time interaction, and database management.
